# Linear-Regression
This is the basic dataset for Linear Regression, if You are a beginner then use this dataset. Go ahead and perform linear regression Training Models, Prediction Models. I have also attached the code with it but in the code, I have not used SCikit Learn Library, therefore, I have performed all the steps like forwarding Propagation, cost function, Backward propagation, and Update Parameter.
